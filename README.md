# Nearest-Color utility for determining the closest tailwind (3) css color match for a hex color-code

## Usage

```
nc <6-digit-hex-color-without-leading-#>
```

For example:

```
nc 336699
```

Would result in:

```
The color 336699 maps onto the tailwind color 'colors.cyan 700' (#0e7490)
```

## How it works

Simple distance between! Nothing fancy at all.
